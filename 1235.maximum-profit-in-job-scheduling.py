#
# We have n jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from startTime[i] to
# endTime[i], obtaining a profit of profit[i].
# 
# You're given the startTime, endTime and profit arrays, return the maximum
# profit you can take such that there are no two jobs in the subset with
# overlapping time range.
# 
# If you choose a job that ends at time X you will be able to start another job
# that starts at time X.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]
# Output: 120
# Explanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth job. 
# Time range [1-3]+[3-6] , we get profit of 120 = 50 + 70.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# ‚Å†
# 
# 
# Input: startTime = [1,2,3,4,6], endTime = [3,5,10,6,9], profit =
# [20,20,100,70,60]
# Output: 150
# Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job. 
# Profit obtained 150 = 20 + 70 + 60.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: startTime = [1,1,1], endTime = [2,3,4], profit = [5,6,4]
# Output: 6
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= startTime.length == endTime.length == profit.length <= 5 * 10^4
# 1 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= 10^9
# 1 <= profit[i] <= 10^4
