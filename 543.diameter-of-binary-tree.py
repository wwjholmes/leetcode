#
# Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the
# tree.
# 
# The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any
# two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
# 
# The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges
# between them.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 3is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2]
# Output: 1
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
# 
# 
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        longest_path = 0

        def dfs(node: TreeNode):
            if not node:
                return (0, 0)
            left_depth, left_path = dfs(node.left)
            right_depth, right_path = dfs(node.right)
            longest_path = max(left_path, right_path, left_depth + right_depth)
            return (max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1, longest_path)
        return dfs(root)[1]
